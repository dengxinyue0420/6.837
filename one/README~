1. To complile in Linux, in the build folder, run cmake.
   Then run make install, and it should generate a exec file in one/inst/, called a1.
   To run the file with swp, run one/inst/a1 swp/<swp file>

2. Collabrote with no one.

3. I got most of help from Piazza and office hour. TAs are really helpful. 

4. I didn't find any problem with my code. However, one thing to be noticed, I didn't implement any extra credit, so my output for weirder.swp doesn't match the sample solution. I asked in Piazza, and TA said it is enough for the basic assignment.

5. No, I didn't implement any.

6. The transformation matrix was mentioned too early in the assignment. I am confused for that for a while.
